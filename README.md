# Unexpected Results from MATLAB Function due to Logical Error

This repository contains a MATLAB function that produces unexpected results due to a logical error in its conditional statement. The `bug.m` file demonstrates the problematic code, and the `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version.

## Problem Description

The function `myFunction` is intended to perform a specific calculation based on a conditional statement.  However, a flaw in the logic of the conditional statement causes it to return incorrect results under certain conditions.

## Solution

The corrected code in `bugSolution.m` addresses the logical error in the conditional statement, leading to the expected output.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.m` and `bugSolution.m` in MATLAB.
3. Run the test case provided to observe the incorrect and correct results.
